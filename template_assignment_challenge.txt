Customizing the Django Admin for Improved Development Efficiency

The Django Admin app is a powerful built-in tool that provides a user-friendly interface for managing database records.
Customizing the admin interface can significantly enhance the efficiency of writing, testing, and debugging code in this assignment.

1. Enhancing Django Admin for Managing URLs and Views
Since urls.py and views.py define the core request-response cycle of our application, we can customize the Django Admin to:

Automatically display registered URL patterns: This would help developers see which views are linked to specific URLs.
Provide a direct link to view each page in the frontend: This would allow quick navigation from the Admin to test different views.
Customization 1: Admin Action to View URL Mappings
To improve visibility into registered URL patterns, we can create a custom admin action that lists all URLs available in urls.py.

Steps to Implement:1) Modify the admin.py file to include a custom admin action that fetches all registered URLs. 2) Display this action in the Django Admin for easy reference.
In admin.py:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import get_resolver

class URLAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def show_registered_urls(self, request):
        url_patterns = get_resolver().url_patterns
        return "\n".join([str(pattern) for pattern in url_patterns])

    show_registered_urls.short_description = "Show all registered URLs"

admin.site.register(URLAdmin)

Using this function, it will provide a list of all available URLs, making debugging easier.
