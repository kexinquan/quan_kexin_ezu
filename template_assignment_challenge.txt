The Django Admin site provides a powerful interface for managing database records, debugging models, and testing business logic. For this weekâ€™s assignment, which involves working with urls.py, views.py, and template files, customizing the Django Admin can significantly improve efficiency in testing and managing our application.

Customization: Improving URL Management with Custom Admin Actions
As we modify and test urls.py, it is often difficult to track dynamic URL routing or manually check route configurations.
Add a custom admin action to display active URLs, making it easier to debug and validate URL patterns.
Implementation Steps:
1. Create an admin action that lists active URLs.
2. Register it in admin.py so it appears as a button in the Django Admin panel.

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import get_resolver
from django.http import HttpResponse

@admin.action(description="Show Active URLs")
def show_urls(modeladmin, request, queryset):
    urlconf = get_resolver()
    urls = "\n".join([str(pattern.pattern) for pattern in urlconf.url_patterns])
    return HttpResponse(f"<pre>{urls}</pre>")

class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    actions = [show_urls]

admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)


In this way, it allows quick verification of urls.py changes directly in the Admin panel, which helps ensure URL patterns are correctly mapped without checking them manually.
