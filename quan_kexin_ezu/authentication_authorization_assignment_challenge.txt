Authentication and Authorization Assignment


One effective customization would be the addition of inline editing of Registration objects
directly within the Student admin interface. By using Django’s `TabularInline` feature,
we can allow administrators and developers to create and edit a student’s course registrations
from the student’s detail page in the admin. This eliminates the need to switch back and forth
between the Student and Registration models, streamlining the process of verifying enrollment
relationships and updating data during testing.

This customization would make our work significantly easier by allowing for quicker data entry
and a clearer overview of student-section associations. It also provides a more intuitive experience
for anyone managing student records during development or in a production environment.
To implement this change, we would add a `RegistrationInline` class in `admin.py`, and register it
as an inline within a custom `StudentAdmin` class. We can use Django’s built-in `autocomplete_fields`
for sections to improve form usability and performance.

Overall, this small but impactful customization would improve both development speed and administrative
usability, which is a valuable addon to our Django Admin .
