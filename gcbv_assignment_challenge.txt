Django Admin Customization for EZU Assignment

My proposed customization: Inline Editing for Registration within StudentAdmin. For allowing Registration objects to
be edited directly on the Student admin detail page using TabularInline or StackedInline.
This lets developers or admins assign students to sections or update registrations quickly without switching between models.
The benefit of this customization can 1. speed up testing and data entry during development.
2. Reduces context switching when validating relationships between students and their registered sections.
3. Improves admin usability by providing a consolidated view of student registration activity.

from django.contrib import admin
from courseinfo.models import Student, Registration

class RegistrationInline(admin.TabularInline):  # or admin.StackedInline
    model = Registration
    extra = 1  # show 1 empty row for adding new
    autocomplete_fields = ['section']

@admin.register(Student)
class StudentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['first_name', 'last_name']
    inlines = [RegistrationInline]
